      "text": "Fukuivenator, a small theropod from the Kitadani Formation in Cretaceous Japan. It was small theropod that picked on small prey, but would\u0027ve much preferred shrubbery with flat teeth. A early Therizinosauria that via convergent evolution looked like a dromaeosaur. First discovered and described in 2016, in 2021 it was determined to be a basal member of Therizinosauria."
