It's a dense forest biome with massive Sequoia trees mixed with conifer and young sequoia trees. It's the perfect place to get Sequoia wood, with one tree most likly giving you a life-time supply. Is not like the other forest biome, not being a spawning location. However, it would be the perfect place to build a treehouse. Or a dinosaur park."
